Events between processes. Built on top of Illuminate\Events and ZeroMQ.

It could be used for building distributed **PHP** applications
and asynchronous **event** processing systems with **ZeroMQ** as transport for messages.

## Installation

Install package using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
```
composer require ptrofimov/zeroevents:3.*
```

## Quick Introduction

* 1. **In the first process:** subscribe EventListener to desired events.

```php
Event::listen('my.events.*', new EventListener(['connect' => 'ipc://my.ipc']));
```

In EventListener constructor could be passed either array of options (will be merged with default options)
or string (path to options for Config::get())

* 2. **In the second process:** define listeners for events. And run event service that will listen to messages
on socket and fire incoming events.

```php
Event::listen('my.events.*', function () {
    echo 'Catched event:', Event::firing(), PHP_EOL;
});

(new EventService)
    ->listen(new EventListener(['bind' => 'ipc://my.ipc']))
    ->run();
```

That's it. Each time the event is fired in first process, that will be transferred to the second process and be fired there as well.

## EventSocket class

EventSocket PHP class is inherited from ZMQSocket. Its supports all native methods like connect and send,
plus it adds methods for sending and receiving events with ZeroMQ.

### Methods

* **encode**(string *event*, array *payload*) - serialize event and payload into array of frames before sending
 * event goes as string in the first frame of message
 * payload is serialized in JSON(by default) and goes in the following frames of message
 * encode method is used in **push** method
* **decode**(array *frames*) - unserialize event and payload from array of frames after receiving
 * return array [event, payload]
 * event is supposed to go as string in the first frame of message
 * payload is supposed to go as serialized in JSON in the following frames of message
 * decode method is used in **pull** method

### Connecting socket

You can use usual way to connect to ZeroMQ socket via calling the constructor of ZMQSocket
or, better, use **EventListener** that gives you connected socket on the base of options from config.

```php
use ZeroEvents\EventSocket;

$socket = new EventSocket(new ZMQContext, ZMQ::SOCKET_PUSH);
$socket->connect('ipc:///var/tmp/test.ipc');
```

### Pushing events

It is recommended to listen to events that occur during sending of the message (ttl expired, out of connection)
to handle them.

```php
Event::listen('zeroevents.push.error', function () {
    // logging or something else
});

$socket->push('event', ['payload']);
```

## EventListener class

EventListener PHP class is supposed to be passed to event dispatcher as listener callback.
It has magic method **__invoke**, that is called, when an event is fired.
EventListener creates EventSocket instance on-demand (lazy connection) and call method **EventSocket::push**.

```php
Event::listen('my.events.*', new EventListener('my.socket.config.key'));
```

Constructor accepts either string (config key) or array of options.

### Connection options

```php
$options = [

    'example.connection' => [

        /*
         * Number of io-threads in context, default = 1
         */

        'threads' => 1,

        /*
         * Persistent context is stored over multiple requests, default = false
         */

        'is_persistent' => false,

        /*
         * Socket type
         *
         * Full list of available types http://php.net/manual/en/class.zmq.php
         * Description of sockets http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc11
         */

        'socket_type' => ZMQ::SOCKET_PUSH,

        /*
         * Default options for ZeroMQ socket
         */

        'socket_options' => [
            ZMQ::SOCKOPT_LINGER => 2000, // wait before disconnect (ms)
            ZMQ::SOCKOPT_SNDTIMEO => 2000, // send message timeout (ms)
            ZMQ::SOCKOPT_RCVTIMEO => 2000, // receive message timeout (ms)
        ],

        /*
         * Addresses to bind. Only one process can bind address
         *
         * About available transports (inproc, ipc, tcp) http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc13
         */

        'bind' => [
            'tcp://127.0.0.1:5555',
        ],

        /*
         * Addresses of sockets, the same time can be connected multiple addresses
         *
         * About available transports (inproc, ipc, tcp) http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc13
         */

        'connect' => [
            'tcp://127.0.0.1:5555',
        ],

        /*
         * Type of events to subscribe. Events masks (*) are not here supported.
         *
         * Only useful for SOCKET_SUB socket type
         */

        'subscribe' => 'my.events',

        /*
         * Send/wait confirmation after sending/receiving message
         */

        'confirmed' => false,

        /*
        * Serializer Interface through which message payload is serialized before sending
        */

        'serializer' => 'ZeroEvents\Serializers\JsonSerializer'
    ],
];
```

## EventService class

Class is used to listen to incoming events and fire them.

### Polling sockets

EventService class is able to listen to several sockets the same time.

```php
(new EventService)
    ->listen(new EventListener(['connect' => 'ipc://first.ipc']))
    ->listen(new EventListener(['connect' => 'ipc://second.ipc']))
    ->run();
```

### Idle events

You can specify the polling time - max time that service waits for incoming events
and if there are no such events, it fires **zeroevents.service.idle** event,
which you can handle and execute your own code while there is no work for the service.

### System signals

EventService class has default handler for system POSIX signals.
It ignores **SIGHUP**, and gracefully stops on **SIGTERM** and **SIGINT** signals.
Sure, you could define your own system signal handler.

### Stopping the service

Normally, the service is being stopped by system signal.
But you could easily stop the service by firing **zeroevents.service.stop** event.
